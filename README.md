# Age Guess

## Description
This is an age analysis project of some photographs in which some people are, these photographs are presented to the players, who must guess the age of the person at the time of the photograph.
In the project, five files are delivered that have different types of information about the participants, the photographs and the access to them, in addition a number of points is included for each of the people who try to guess the ages of the people.
The data analysis was done in a period of four days and that is why in the code to be presented it can be seen that each of the calculations carried out corresponds to a day that is duly marked with a title so that the sequence of the analysis is understood.

## Planning by day

1. Day 1 
Read the Document "The AgeGuess database, an open online resource on chronological and perceived ages of people aged 5–100" and Explore the data of the five files
2. Day 2 
Basic Analysis of the five files and basic Visualizations of the data
3. Day 3 
Searching Errors in the tables and building a new column to compare the Age Guessing to Real Age 
4. Day 4 
Join some of the tables to create queries and create Rankings by points, gender, country
